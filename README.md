## What is Mushroom dashboard strategy?

Mushroom dashboard strategy provides a strategy for Home assistant to automatically create a dashboard using Mushroom
cards, the area configuration and entity configuration.

My goal is to propose a way to create powerful dashboards without the need of spending hours manually creating them.

**Note:** This is my first javascript code and GitHub repository. Any recommendations are always welcome.

### Features

- üõ† Automatically create dashboard with three lines of yaml.
- üòç Built-in Views for device-specific controls.
- üé® Many options to customize to fit your needs.
