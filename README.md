## What is the Mushroom dashboard strategy?

Easily installable from [HACs][hacsUrl], the Mushroom dashboard strategy provides a strategy for Home Assistant to automatically create a dashboard. It 
uses the area configuration to create a home view with room cards which lead you to subviews to view all 
devices and entities in that room. It also creates various other views for controlling all lights, fans and
other domains. With many options, you can create it how you like it one time and it will dynamically update
whenever you move or add a new device leaving you with a perfect dashboard. 

### Features

- 🛠 Automatically create a dashboard with just three lines of YAML.
- 😍 Built-in Views for device-specific controls.
- 🎨 Many options to customize to fit your needs.
